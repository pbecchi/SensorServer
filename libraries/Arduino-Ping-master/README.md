Arduino-Ping
============

ICMP ping library for the Arduino

To use, copy the icmp_ping directory into the libraries directory of your Arduino folder.

e.g. cp ~/Arduino-Ping/icmp_ping /usr/share/arduino/libraries/icmp_ping

Then restart the Arduino software if necessary, and icmp_ping should be available under the libraries dropdown.

See the included sketch for example usage.
See the header (ICMP.h) for API documentation.

The master branch currently requires at least version 1.5.5 beta of the Arduino software. For older versions of the
Arduino software, use version 2.1. After cloning:

cd Arduino-Ping
git checkout version2.1
