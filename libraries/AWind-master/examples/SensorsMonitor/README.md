SensorsMonitor
------------
Introduction
------------
SensorsMonitor example is intended to demonstrate real scenario for the use of AWind library: 
Different temperature, humidity and air pressure sensors are measured and simultaneously visualized as digits or as chart where scaling can be selected between seconds, minutes and hours. 
Additionally night and day modes are supported as well. The switch between modes is implemented via touch.
If measured values are exceed the threshold values, corresponding sensor window changes it's background color to red.
